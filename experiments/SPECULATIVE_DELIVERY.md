# Speculative queue delivery prototype

Status: experimental branch, disabled by default, not approved for production adoption. This branch preserves staged early delivery and the selected bounded dispatch handoff. Compio and the asynchronous storage backend are excluded; storage uses the ordinary inline writer path.

## Build and run

Use matching sibling checkouts of Fibril and Keratin at `experiment/speculative-delivery`, plus the normal sibling Ganglion checkout. Fibril's workspace patches resolve those local dependencies. Build the server with `cargo build --release -p fibril --bin fibril-server` and run the existing broker configuration.

The development-only environment setting `FIBRIL_EXPERIMENTAL_QUEUE_SPECULATION` selects:

- `0` (default): ordinary durable delivery and confirmation.
- `1`: eligible staged messages can be delivered early; producer confirmation still requires durability.
- `2`: eligible staged messages can be delivered early; producer confirmation can follow durability or a valid consumer processing ACK. This is a different confirmation contract and still needs targeted crash validation.

The retained low-overhead admission/handoff variant uses `FIBRIL_EXPERIMENTAL_SPEC_ADMISSION=cheap` and `FIBRIL_EXPERIMENTAL_SPEC_HANDOFF=1`. Optional sampled internal traces use `FIBRIL_EXPERIMENTAL_SPEC_TRACE=1`; leave them off for clean timing comparisons.

## Boundaries

Eligible queues are local-only, without follower assignments. Replicated queues use the ordinary path regardless of their configured confirmation policy. TTL, delayed messages, exclusive-consumer constraints, holds, admission pressure and unavailable consumer credit fall back to ordinary delivery. Admission is bounded by byte and item budgets (32 MiB estimated bytes and 4096 items); the dispatch handoff requests about 250 microseconds and is subject to scheduler delay.

Messages are staged and assigned real offsets before early dispatch. Both storage logs still persist them. Persistent `fibril.message_id` metadata identifies a message across redelivery, while the delivery tag identifies a particular delivery attempt. `fibril.speculative` marks early delivery. The broker reserves its internal metadata namespace; SDK automatic deduplication is not implemented. Ordinary and early paths preserve partition delivery order through their registration/fallback coordination.

## Adoption gates

1. Force actual early delivery and consumer ACK before durability, then inject process loss or persistence failure at confirmation and settlement seams. Verify the processing-ACK contract, stable redelivery identity and producer outcomes after restart. Earlier broad worker/requester loss probes mostly exercised durable fallback and do not close this gate.
2. Exercise prolonged pressure on both admission budgets, slow/disconnected consumers, randomized early/fallback transitions and expiry-related races.
3. Define production configuration and API documentation for the separate confirmation contracts, metadata and application-owned deduplication.
4. Repeat ordinary and speculative regressions and representative physical-storage measurements after integration with current main. Keep replicated speculation excluded until separately designed.

The branch includes focused speculative lifecycle tests, ordinary ordering coverage and the ACK ownership/accounting fixes. SIGKILL tests exercise process loss and do not simulate sudden power loss. The prototype's test-only commit gate and injected failure controls are research seams, not deployment settings.

## Preserved evidence

The local handoff contains the original staged-delivery, dispatch-handoff, physical SATA/NVMe, service-RPC and fault experiments. This branch originates from the service-cluster prototype, which includes the later durable application-order fix; it excludes the subsequent replication timing/ablation experiments. No competitor benchmark results are published with it. New validation results for this extracted branch are recorded below.

Extraction validation: `cargo test --offline -p stroma-core` passed 292 tests with one existing ignored test. Both the ordinary pause-hook regression and observer-based ordering regression are retained. This validates the extracted code shape and does not close the crash-safety gates above.
